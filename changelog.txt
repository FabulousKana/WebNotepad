WebNotepad, Version 1.4

- Whole code rewritten for better quality.
- Removed fonts.google.com for enhanced privacy.
- User interface almost completely changed to look more modern and flat.
- Added rel="noopener noreferrer" to external links.
- Added refresh button in links menu.
- Mouse-over top border in links now shows what links are on HTTPS (green) or HTTP (blue)

Some functions are still unavailable because it needs some time,
if you need them you can use Version 1.3 available on my website.

The rest of missing functions will become available again in version 1.5.
